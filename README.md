This assignment is focus on targeting different element in HTML and CSS from JavaScript. Being careful and keep formatting the code are essential. Also, it took a while for me to figure out which methods are DOM method and which are jQuery method. When the code is mixed with both methods, it won't work. Local storage is a confusing concept. I need some time to remember the syntax and the difference between local storage and session storage.[Link to the website](https://lorddominic.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)
